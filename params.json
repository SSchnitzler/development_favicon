{"name":"Development favicon","tagline":"A chrome extension to add color effects to favicons based on URL regex match patterns. ","body":"## Why\r\n\r\nI make websites (for [Commercial Progression](http://www.commercialprogression.com/)), and I found myself\r\nwith tons of tabs open per project; my local development site, the staging server, maybe even production.\r\nEach tab had the same favicon and often the same page title, so it wasn't possible at a glance to know\r\nwhich tab was which without opening it.\r\n\r\nThis extension lets you target URLs with a regex match pattern (so .*\\.local.* for my local environment) and\r\napply effects to the favicon. I've got my local with a green stripe across the top, the staging server with a\r\nyellow one, and could set different production environments with different colors and effects.\r\n\r\nAnother idea would be to match and apply effects for different signed-in Google accounts, so I'd know which\r\nGoogle Drive is open.\r\n\r\nStuff like that.\r\n\r\n## How\r\n\r\nIt's written to be as asynchronous, event-driven, and resource-light as possible.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to fix bugs, add features, improve performance, or otherwise contribute to the project, I'm very\r\nopen to pull requests.\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in Development Favicon!\r\n","google":"UA-697953-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
